								<h3>My Experience</h3>
								<p>I have been listening to music for as long as I have lived, and writing it for at least five of those years. In that time, I have adapted my style with many genres of music. An amalgamation of electronic, orchestral, acoustic, and rock, define my style. Getting to this point has been a journey through discovery and long, arduous study which is ongoing and endless. My motivation to write music comes from a deep belief that it must be heard, and that process is being fulfilled with my pursuit to write for film.</p>

								<p>Part of this journey is my love of writing with emotion. It is something that is constantly present in my music and expresses my feelings better than words. From what I have learned of truth in art, I believe that true emotion is the key to how I write. My knowledge isn't just my own. I owe it to some amazing professors and mentors in my life that have helped me become an artist and a composer.</p>

								<h4>My Creative Process and Work</h4>
								<p>Being satisfied with a sound or a melody, is an achievement. I go through several iterations before I discover something I am happy with. But when I do find that perfect sound, it makes the entire composition fall into place. Finding that sound, or theme to fit the overall tone, is therefore crucial to how I write music. I start my compositions with a cup of tea, a pencil, and a blank manuscript. The rest is up to how I feel that day, or what I want to convey in the music.</p>

								<p>When it comes to my style, I never shy away from darker themes. In fact, it is something I excel in. Part of my palette comes from electronic music, which was my earliest experience with writing. So much of the distorted and dark tones of the equivalent electronic genre, have blended with my compositions for orchestra. I use synthesizers and sampling daily, and try to use them in places that improve the sonic properties of my music. In other words, they can make things sound more varied and complex. Other parts of my sound include folly and recorded instruments. The folly can range from a recording of the outdoors, to hitting two rubber soled slippers together to make a percussive sound. For recorded instruments, I gravitate towards piano and acoustic guitar, since they are always available to me. It is important for me to have an vast range of sounds to select from. When all is said and done, the resulting music is unique and textured.</p>
