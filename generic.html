								<h3>My Experience</h3>
								<p>I have been writing music for many years. In that time, I have adapted my style from many genres of music. A hybrid of electronic, orchestral, acoustic, and contemporary techniques, which define my style. Reaching this point has been a journey through discovery and study which grows with experience. My motivation to write comes from a desire to tell stories through music, and that process is being fulfilled with my pursuit to compose for film, tv, and games.</p>

								<p>Part of this journey is my love of writing with emotion. It is something that is vital in effectively scoring. From what I have learned of truth in art, I believe that influencing ones emotion through music transforms the work into something more than itself.</p>

								<h4>My Creative Process and Work</h4>
								<p>Being satisfied with a sound or a melody is an achievement. When I find that perfect sound, it makes the entire composition come into its own. Finding that sound, or theme to fit the overall tone is crucial to the quality of the soundtrack. I start my writing with a cup of tea or coffee, a pencil, and a blank manuscript. The rest is up to what I feel from the work, and what I want to convey in the music.</p>

								<p>When it comes to my style, I never shy away from darker themes. In fact, it is something I excel in. Part of my musical palette comes from electronic music, which was my earliest experience with writing. So much of the distorted and dark tones of the equivalent electronic genre, have blended with my compositions for orchestra. I use synthesizers and sampling daily. I try to use them in places that improve the sonic properties of my music. In other words, they can make things sound more varied and complex. Other parts of my sound often include recorded instruments. For these, I tend to gravitate towards piano and acoustic guitar, since they are always available to me. It is important to have a vast range of sounds to choose from. When all is said and done, I often find that the resulting sound is unique and textured.</p>
